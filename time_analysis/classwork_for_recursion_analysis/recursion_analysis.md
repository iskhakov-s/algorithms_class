### 1 - Add To
The function's recursion occurs by subtraction, which is linearly approaching the base case:
`O(n)`

The example goes: `8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0`

### 2 - Power 10
The function's recursion occurs by division, which logarithmically approaches the base case:
`O(log(n))`

The example goes: `36,18,9,4,2,1,0`

### 3 - Boring
The function's recursion occurs by division, which logarithmically approaches the base case:
`O(log(n))`

The example goes: `12,6,3,1,0`

### 4 - List to Number
